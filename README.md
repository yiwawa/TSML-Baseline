RML24 is the first dataset designed specifically for deep learning applications in satellite signal identification and demodulation. RML24 integrates telemetry and communication signals in Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT & C) systems and simulates the effects of signal impairments in real satellite channels. The dataset utilizes a software-defined radio (SDR) platform and radio frequency (RF) transceivers to perform rigorous over-the-air measurements and validate the collected data. RML24 provides researchers with fundamental data and modeling benchmarks for widely used modulation classification models in the hope of facilitating the algorithmic validation and development of intelligent and adaptive satellite communication systems and advancing the development of datadriven satellite communication technologies.
